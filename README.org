* What is reason

Reason is a way to simplify userspace drivers for peripherals like keyboards and mice.

* How to interface with reason

The main way to interface with reason as a control app is through DBus

* Use case

Several apps interface with peripherals in their own way, like openrgb and libratbag or ckbnext, but conflict when being used together; If we were able to standardize the way we control these devices and let them work at the same time we wold be able to have a coherent RGB light show thanks to openrgb and the ability to remap buttons with libratbag and ckbnext.
